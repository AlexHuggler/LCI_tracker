# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 24, 2026 · Last Updated: February 24, 2026

PoolFlow ("we", "our", or "the app") is developed by Alex Huggler. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected when you use the PoolFlow iOS application.

## 1. Information We Collect

PoolFlow is designed with privacy in mind. We minimize data collection wherever possible.

**Data you provide directly:**

- Pool and customer information (names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, gate access notes)
- Water chemistry readings and service logs
- Chemical inventory data
- Equipment information (make, model, serial numbers)
- Service photos

**Data collected automatically:**

- Device locale and region (used to set default units and language)
- Approximate location data via Apple MapKit (used only for address autocomplete and route optimization)

## 2. How Your Data Is Stored

All pool, customer, service, inventory, and equipment data is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework. PoolFlow does not operate a backend server. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to:

- Enable iCloud Sync (Pro feature) — data syncs via Apple's CloudKit infrastructure to your personal iCloud account
- Export a backup file (.zip) — saved wherever you choose (Files, AirDrop, etc.)
- Export CSV or PDF reports — shared via the iOS share sheet
- Email a service report to a customer

## 3. Third-Party Services

**RevenueCat:** We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases. RevenueCat may collect anonymized transaction data, device identifiers, and purchase history. RevenueCat's privacy policy is available at [revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

**Apple MapKit:** PoolFlow uses Apple MapKit for address autocomplete, geocoding, and driving time estimates. Apple's privacy policy applies to these services.

**Apple CloudKit (iCloud):** If you enable iCloud Sync (Pro feature), your data is synced through Apple's CloudKit service under your personal iCloud account. Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy apply.

PoolFlow does not use any analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking pixels.

## 4. Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect health, fitness, or biometric data
- We do not track your browsing activity or app usage analytics
- We do not sell, rent, or share your data with advertisers or data brokers
- We do not use third-party analytics or crash reporting SDKs
- We do not collect financial account or payment information (subscriptions are handled by Apple and RevenueCat)

## 5. Location Data

PoolFlow uses Apple MapKit to autocomplete addresses and calculate driving times between pool stops. Location data is sent to Apple's servers as part of MapKit API calls. PoolFlow does not request or store your real-time GPS location. Pool addresses and their geocoded coordinates are stored locally on your device.

## 6. Data Retention

Your data remains on your device for as long as you use the app. You may delete all data at any time via Settings > Clear All App Data. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data. iCloud-synced data persists in your iCloud account until you delete it.

## 7. Children's Privacy

PoolFlow is a professional business tool not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8. Your Rights

Because your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can view, edit, export, or delete any data within the app. No request to us is necessary to access or remove your own data.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of PoolFlow after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
