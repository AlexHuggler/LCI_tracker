  Cyanuric acid (CYA) is the invisible backbone of outdoor pool sanitation, shielding chlorine from ultraviolet degradation. Yet too much of it renders chlorine ineffective, creating a condition many technicians call chlorine lock. This article explains what CYA does at the molecular level, why the ideal range sits between 30 and 50 ppm, and how stabilized chlorine products like dichlor and trichlor steadily push CYA higher with every dose. We cover the critical CYA-to-chlorine ratio, how elevated CYA distorts alkalinity readings and LSI calculations through the adjusted alkalinity formula, and why partial draining remains the only reliable method for reducing CYA concentration. Service professionals will walk away with a clear protocol for diagnosing, communicating, and correcting high-CYA situations.
faq:
  - question: "What happens if CYA is too high?"
    answer: "When CYA exceeds 80-100 ppm, it binds so much free chlorine that the remaining active chlorine (hypochlorous acid) cannot effectively sanitize the water. Algae blooms become persistent, combined chlorine rises, and the pool may appear hazy even with a seemingly adequate free chlorine reading. The only practical remedy is to partially drain and refill the pool with fresh water to dilute the CYA concentration back into the 30-50 ppm target range."
  - question: "How do I lower CYA without draining the pool?"
    answer: "Currently, partial draining and refilling with fresh water is the only widely accepted and reliable method for lowering CYA. Some bio-active CYA reduction products have entered the market, but results are inconsistent and slow. Reverse osmosis water treatment is another option, though it requires specialized equipment and is expensive. For most service professionals, a calculated partial drain remains the fastest, most cost-effective solution."

## Understanding Cyanuric Acid and Its Role in Pool Chemistry

Cyanuric acid, commonly abbreviated as CYA and often sold under the brand name "stabilizer" or "conditioner," is one of the most misunderstood chemicals in the pool service industry. Every outdoor pool needs it, yet too much of it can silently undermine your entire sanitation program. For service professionals managing dozens of accounts, understanding the nuances of CYA is not optional. It is foundational.

At its core, CYA is a chemical shield. When chlorine is added to pool water, it forms hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active sanitizing agent that kills bacteria, viruses, and algae. The problem is that ultraviolet radiation from sunlight destroys HOCl rapidly. On a bright summer day, an unprotected pool can lose 75 to 90 percent of its free chlorine within two hours. CYA bonds with chlorine molecules to form chlorinated isocyanurates, which are far more resistant to UV degradation. This bonded chlorine is released slowly as free chlorine is consumed, effectively extending chlorine's working life in the water.

Without CYA, you would burn through chlorine at an unsustainable rate. With the right amount, you maintain a steady residual that keeps the water safe between service visits.

## The Ideal CYA Range: 30 to 50 PPM

The industry consensus places the ideal CYA concentration for residential pools between 30 and 50 ppm. At this range, you get meaningful UV protection without significantly diminishing chlorine's sanitizing power. Some saltwater pool operators push toward 60 to 80 ppm because salt chlorine generators produce chlorine continuously, but even in those systems, crossing 80 ppm introduces real risks.

As CYA concentration increases, a greater percentage of total free chlorine is bound and unavailable for sanitization. At 30 ppm CYA, roughly 3 percent of free chlorine remains as active HOCl at a pH of 7.5. At 100 ppm CYA, that figure drops below 1.5 percent. The chlorine is still technically "there" when you test for it, but it is not doing its job.

This is the phenomenon many technicians refer to as **chlorine lock**, though the more accurate description is that the ratio of active to bound chlorine has shifted too far toward the inactive side.

## Why CYA Accumulates Over Time

CYA accumulation is an inevitable consequence of using stabilized chlorine products, specifically **dichlor** (sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione) and **trichlor** (trichloroisocyanuric acid). These are the most common forms of chlorine in residential pool care, found in tablets, granules, and pucks.

Every time you add a trichlor tablet to a floater or inline chlorinator, you are adding both chlorine and CYA. For every 10 ppm of free chlorine delivered by trichlor, approximately 6 ppm of CYA is also introduced. A pool running on trichlor tablets from May through September can easily see CYA climb from 40 ppm to well over 100 ppm.

The critical point: **chlorine is consumed, but CYA is not**. Chlorine gets used up killing contaminants and breaking down under UV. CYA does not evaporate, does not get filtered out, and degrades extremely slowly. The only meaningful ways CYA leaves a pool are through splash-out, backwashing, and deliberate draining.

## The CYA-to-Chlorine Ratio

Rather than relying on a single free chlorine target, experienced technicians manage the **CYA-to-free-chlorine ratio**. The widely referenced guideline is to maintain free chlorine at approximately 7.5 percent of the CYA level:

- At 30 ppm CYA, target 2 to 3 ppm free chlorine
- At 50 ppm CYA, target 4 ppm free chlorine
- At 80 ppm CYA, target 6 ppm free chlorine
- At 100 ppm CYA, target 7 to 8 ppm free chlorine

Notice the problem. As CYA climbs, the chlorine requirement climbs with it. At 100 ppm CYA, you are burning through chlorine at a much higher rate just to match the sanitizing effect you had at 30 ppm with a fraction of the chlorine. Chemical costs rise, customer complaints about chlorine smell increase (because more combined chlorine forms), and the risk of algae breakthrough grows.

The ratio is also a powerful diagnostic tool. If a pool has persistent algae despite 3 ppm free chlorine, testing CYA may reveal it sitting at 120 ppm. At that level, 3 ppm free chlorine is functionally useless.

## How CYA Affects LSI and Adjusted Alkalinity

CYA also impacts the **Langelier Saturation Index (LSI)**, the gold standard for predicting whether water is corrosive or scale-forming. When CYA is present, a portion of measured alkalinity is contributed by cyanurate alkalinity rather than carbonate alkalinity, which skews the LSI calculation.

This is where the **adjusted alkalinity** formula becomes essential:

**Adjusted Alkalinity = Total Alkalinity - (CYA / 3)**

If your total alkalinity test reads 100 ppm and CYA is 60 ppm, adjusted alkalinity is 100 - (60 / 3) = 80 ppm. Using the unadjusted figure in your LSI calculation would overestimate the water's buffering capacity and could lead you to believe the water is balanced when it is actually slightly corrosive.

This correction matters enormously for managing plaster, pebble, or tile surfaces. Failing to account for CYA can lead to etching on plaster pools. It also means your [chemical dosing calculations](/blog/chemical-dosing-calculations-pool-service/) for alkalinity adjustment may be off if you are not starting from the corrected number. At 120 ppm CYA, you are subtracting 40 ppm from your alkalinity reading, a shift that can move your LSI from balanced into corrosive territory.

## Partial Drain: The Only Reliable Reduction Method

Here is the reality every pool service professional must communicate to their customers: **the only proven, cost-effective way to lower CYA is to partially drain and refill the pool**. No chemical breaks down CYA in a meaningful timeframe. Some enzymatic products claim to reduce CYA, but the process is slow, unpredictable, and often insufficient for pools well above 100 ppm.

The math is straightforward. If CYA is at 120 ppm and your target is 40 ppm, you need to remove approximately two-thirds of the water. In practice, most technicians drain 25 to 50 percent at a time, retest, and repeat if necessary. This staged approach is safer and reduces the risk of hydrostatic uplift on the pool shell.

A practical protocol:

1. **Test CYA accurately** using a turbidity-based test (melamine reagent) rather than test strips.
2. **Calculate the drain percentage:** 1 - (Target CYA / Current CYA). For 120 down to 40: 1 - (40/120) = 67 percent.
3. **Drain in stages.** No more than one-third at a time to protect the shell.
4. **Refill and circulate** for at least two hours before retesting.
5. **Rebalance all chemistry.** Fresh fill water changes pH, alkalinity, calcium hardness, and chlorine levels. Review your [seasonal maintenance checklist](/blog/seasonal-pool-maintenance-checklist/) for comprehensive rebalancing guidance.

The most important part of this process is **customer communication**. Frame it in terms they care about: their chlorine is not working, algae will keep coming back, and this is the only fix.

## Dichlor and Trichlor: The CYA Sources Hiding in Plain Sight

Many pool owners do not realize that their primary chlorine source is also their primary CYA source.

**Trichlor tablets** contain approximately 54 percent available chlorine and 57 percent CYA by weight. In a 10,000-gallon pool, one pound of trichlor raises CYA by approximately 7 ppm.

**Dichlor granules** contain approximately 56 percent available chlorine and about 57 percent CYA by weight. In a 10,000-gallon pool, one pound of dichlor raises CYA by approximately 9 ppm.

**Liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)** and **cal-hypo (calcium hypochlorite)** contain zero CYA. This is why many service professionals prefer liquid chlorine for regular dosing once the initial CYA level is established with a standalone stabilizer product.

The strategic approach: at the start of the season, establish CYA at 30 to 50 ppm using granular stabilizer. Then maintain chlorine throughout the season using liquid chlorine or cal-hypo, which add no additional CYA. If the customer uses trichlor tablets, educate them about CYA accumulation and plan for a mid-season CYA test with a potential partial drain.

## Monitoring and Common Mistakes

CYA does not change rapidly. For most residential accounts, testing once per month during the active season is sufficient. Test at the start of the season to establish a baseline, monthly through summer, and at closing. Record every reading, as the data over time reveals accumulation patterns and helps you predict when drains will be needed.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

**Adding more chlorine to solve a high-CYA problem.** If the CYA-to-chlorine ratio is off, adding chlorine is a temporary bandage that does not address the root cause.

**Ignoring CYA in LSI calculations.** Failing to use the adjusted alkalinity formula leads to inaccurate balance assessments. This is especially problematic for [pool service profitability](/blog/pool-service-profitability-guide/) because surface damage from corrosive water results in costly callbacks.

**Not educating the customer.** Come prepared with data when recommending a drain. Show the CYA reading, explain the ratio, and present the cost comparison between excessive chlorine use and a one-time drain-and-refill.

**Draining the entire pool at once.** Full drains carry risk for fiberglass, vinyl-liner, and high-water-table pools. Always drain in stages.
