  Many pool service technicians unknowingly service unprofitable accounts that drain time, chemicals, and profit from their business. The 30 percent rule provides a quick diagnostic: if chemical costs for a pool exceed 30 percent of the monthly service fee, that account is likely losing money once you factor in labor, drive time, and overhead. Common causes of unprofitable pools include large water volume requiring more chemicals, persistent chemistry problems from environmental factors, remote locations that add drive time, and service fees that were set too low at onboarding. Identifying money-losers requires tracking actual chemical usage, service time, and drive time per pool over 30 to 90 day windows. Once identified, technicians have four options: raise the price, reduce costs, improve efficiency, or drop the account. This guide provides the framework for making data-driven profitability decisions.
faq:
  - question: "How do I know if a pool account is profitable?"
    answer: "Calculate the true cost to service each pool by adding chemical costs, labor time valued at your target hourly rate, proportional drive time, and a share of fixed overhead like insurance and vehicle expenses. Compare this total cost to the monthly service fee. If costs exceed 70 to 75 percent of revenue, the account is marginally profitable at best. If costs exceed the fee, the account is actively losing money. Track these numbers over a 60 to 90 day window to account for seasonal variation. Most technicians find that 10 to 20 percent of their accounts are unprofitable when analyzed this way."
  - question: "What percentage of revenue should chemical costs be?"
    answer: "Chemical costs should typically represent 15 to 25 percent of the monthly service fee for a healthy, profitable account. The 30 percent threshold serves as a warning line — once chemical costs exceed 30 percent of the fee, the account is likely unprofitable after factoring in labor, drive time, and overhead. Pools with unusually high chemical demand due to large volume, heavy bather loads, environmental contamination, or persistent chemistry issues will naturally have higher chemical cost ratios and require higher service fees to remain profitable."
  - question: "When should I drop an unprofitable pool customer?"
    answer: "Consider dropping a customer after you have exhausted other options: you have raised the price to a level that covers true costs and the customer declined, you have optimized chemical usage and service time without bringing costs in line, and the account continues to lose money over a 90-day analysis window. Also consider dropping accounts where the customer is consistently difficult, requires excessive callbacks, or refuses to approve necessary equipment repairs that would stabilize chemistry. The revenue from an unprofitable account is an illusion — replacing it with a profitable account at the same fee improves your business immediately."

Most pool service technicians can tell you their total monthly revenue without hesitation. Far fewer can tell you which of their individual accounts are profitable and which are quietly draining money from the business. This blind spot is one of the most common and costly mistakes in the pool service industry.

The reality is straightforward: not every pool on your route makes you money. Some pools consume so much in chemicals, drive time, and labor that they actually cost more to service than the monthly fee covers. Identifying and addressing these money-losing accounts is one of the fastest ways to improve your bottom line without adding a single new customer.

## Calculating True Cost Per Pool

The monthly service fee is revenue, not profit. To determine actual profitability, you need to calculate the true cost of servicing each pool. This calculation has four components.

### Chemical Costs

Track the actual chemicals used at each pool over at least a 30-day period. This includes chlorine (liquid, tablets, or granular), acid, algaecide, stabilizer, calcium hardite, and any specialty chemicals. Many technicians estimate chemical costs at the route level, but per-pool tracking reveals enormous variation. A small 10,000-gallon residential pool with stable chemistry might use $15 to $25 in chemicals per month, while a 30,000-gallon pool with high bather loads or environmental contamination can consume $60 to $100.

### Labor Costs

Assign a dollar value to your time. If your target income is $80,000 per year and you work 2,000 hours annually, your labor rate is $40 per hour. A pool that takes 20 minutes to service costs $13.33 in labor. A pool that regularly takes 40 minutes costs $26.67. Include the actual service time, not the scheduled time — if a "15-minute pool" regularly takes 25 minutes due to debris, chemistry problems, or equipment issues, use 25 minutes in your calculation.

### Drive Time Costs

Allocate drive time between stops proportionally. If it takes 12 minutes to drive from the previous stop to this pool, that represents $8.00 in labor plus fuel and vehicle wear costs. A reasonable estimate for vehicle operating costs is $0.50 to $0.70 per mile driven. A 5-mile detour to reach an outlier pool at $0.60 per mile adds $3.00 in vehicle costs plus the labor time to drive it.

### Overhead Allocation

Fixed costs — insurance, vehicle payments, phone, software subscriptions, equipment depreciation, and business licenses — must be spread across all accounts. If your monthly overhead is $2,000 and you service 80 pools, each pool bears $25 in overhead. This number stays relatively constant regardless of the specific pool, but it must be included for an accurate profitability picture.

## The 30 Percent Chemical Cost Rule

A quick diagnostic that works for most residential pool service businesses: if chemical costs for a pool exceed 30 percent of the monthly service fee, that pool is almost certainly unprofitable.

Here is the math. For a pool charged $150 per month:

- Chemical costs at 30 percent: $45
- Remaining for labor, drive time, and overhead: $105
- Typical labor (20 minutes at $40/hour): $13.33
- Typical drive time allocation: $8.00
- Overhead allocation: $25.00
- **Total non-chemical costs:** $46.33
- **Remaining profit:** $58.67

That works. Now consider a pool where chemical costs hit 45 percent:

- Chemical costs at 45 percent: $67.50
- Remaining for everything else: $82.50
- Same labor, drive, and overhead: $46.33
- **Remaining profit:** $36.17

Still profitable, but the margin has been cut nearly in half. Push chemical costs to 60 percent — $90 — and the remaining $60 barely covers the $46.33 in other costs, leaving $13.67 profit for a pool that takes a full month of weekly visits.

The 30 percent rule is a screening tool, not a final verdict. Some pools with 35 percent chemical costs are still profitable if they are fast to service and located between other stops. But any pool crossing the 30 percent line deserves closer scrutiny.

## Common Causes of Unprofitable Pools

Understanding why a pool loses money is essential for deciding how to fix it. The causes fall into predictable categories.

### Large Water Volume

A 40,000-gallon pool requires roughly four times the chemicals of a 10,000-gallon pool but is rarely priced at four times the rate. Technicians commonly charge $150 to $200 for large residential pools that genuinely require $250 to $300 in monthly service fees to be profitable. Volume is the most frequent and most underappreciated driver of chemical costs.

### Persistent Chemistry Problems

Some pools fight you every week. High cyanuric acid levels from tablet overuse require partial drains. Heavy tree canopy drops phosphates and organics that consume chlorine. Poor circulation from undersized or aging equipment creates dead spots where algae thrives. These pools demand more chemicals and more service time than their geography or size alone would suggest.

### Remote Location

A pool that is 15 minutes out of the way on your route costs you 30 minutes of unproductive drive time per visit — two hours per month of labor generating zero revenue. If that pool is also large or chemically demanding, the compounding losses add up fast. Route optimization can mitigate this, but some pools are simply too far from your other customers to service profitably. For more on minimizing drive time waste, see our guide on [route optimization for pool techs](/blog/route-optimization-pool-service/).

### Underpriced Service

The most common cause of unprofitable accounts is a service fee that was set too low at the time of customer acquisition. Many technicians price based on what they think the customer will pay rather than what the pool actually costs to service. Competitive pressure and fear of losing the customer keep prices below sustainable levels.

## Identifying Money-Losers with Data

Gut feel is unreliable for profitability analysis. Two pools on the same street with similar surface appearances can have dramatically different profitability profiles based on water volume, equipment condition, chemical demand, and service duration. You need actual data.

### What to Track

For each pool, record the following over a minimum 30-day period (60 to 90 days is more reliable due to seasonal variation):

1. **Chemical products and quantities used per visit** — not estimates, actual usage
2. **Arrival and departure times** — the real service duration, not the scheduled duration
3. **Drive time from the previous stop** — or a proportional allocation if stops are very close
4. **Any callbacks or extra visits** — these are often excluded from profitability analysis but represent real costs

### Billing Period Analysis

Analyze profitability over different time windows to capture seasonal variation:

- **30-day window:** Good for identifying acute problems like a pool in crisis consuming excessive chemicals
- **60-day window:** Smooths out single-visit anomalies and captures biweekly patterns
- **90-day window:** The most reliable indicator of true baseline profitability, as it accounts for weather shifts and seasonal chemical demand changes

A pool that looks marginally profitable in a mild spring month may become a clear money-loser in the heat of summer when chemical demand spikes.

## Strategies to Fix Unprofitable Accounts

Once you have identified money-losing pools, you have four options, listed in order of preference.

### Raise the Price

The most direct solution is charging a fee that covers actual costs plus your target margin. Calculate the true cost to service the pool, add your desired profit margin (20 to 30 percent is reasonable for residential service), and present the new price to the customer.

Most technicians fear this conversation, but the data makes it easier. When you can show a customer that their pool uses $65 per month in chemicals alone due to its 35,000-gallon volume and heavy tree canopy, a $200 monthly fee becomes obviously reasonable. For advice on navigating these discussions, see our guide on [managing pool customer expectations](/blog/managing-pool-customer-expectations/).

### Reduce Chemical Costs

Sometimes the pool's chemistry can be stabilized to reduce ongoing chemical consumption. Common interventions include:

- **Lowering cyanuric acid** to restore chlorine effectiveness, reducing the amount of chlorine needed
- **Adding phosphate remover** to eliminate the nutrient source for algae, reducing algaecide and shock usage
- **Recommending equipment upgrades** — a variable-speed pump running longer at lower speed improves circulation and reduces chemical demand
- **Adjusting the chemical regimen** — switching from trichlor tablets to liquid chlorine can lower CYA buildup over time

### Improve Efficiency

If the pool's unprofitability is driven primarily by long service times rather than chemical costs, look for efficiency improvements. A pool that takes 35 minutes due to heavy debris might drop to 20 minutes if the customer installs a better screen enclosure or trims overhanging trees. Equipment upgrades like robotic cleaners or better skimmers can reduce manual labor per visit.

### Drop the Account

When a pool remains unprofitable after price increases and efficiency improvements — or when the customer refuses a necessary price adjustment — dropping the account is the correct business decision. Servicing a money-losing pool does not just cost you the loss on that account; it occupies a route slot that could hold a profitable customer.

Give the customer adequate notice (30 days is standard), provide a professional explanation, and offer a referral to another technician if possible. This preserves your reputation while freeing up capacity for profitable growth.

## When to Fire a Customer

Beyond pure profitability math, some accounts are unprofitable in ways that numbers do not fully capture:

- **Excessive callback demands** for issues outside your control (weather, bather load, equipment the customer refuses to repair)
- **Hostile or disrespectful behavior** that affects your team's morale and willingness to perform quality work
- **Refusal to approve necessary repairs** that would stabilize chemistry, creating a cycle of complaints and wasted chemicals
- **Consistent late payments** that increase your administrative burden and cash flow risk

These factors represent real costs that erode profitability beyond what the chemical and labor numbers show. A pool that is marginally profitable on paper but generates weekly complaint calls and quarterly payment disputes is not worth keeping.

## How to Have the Price Conversation

Raising prices is uncomfortable but necessary. A data-driven approach makes it professional rather than confrontational.

1. **Lead with the data.** Show the customer their pool's chemical consumption history and compare it to a typical pool their size. Numbers are harder to argue with than opinions.
2. **Explain the why.** Connect the price increase to specific factors: pool volume, chemical demand, equipment condition, or changes in chemical supply costs.
3. **Provide advance notice.** Give customers 30 to 60 days' notice of price changes. This is both professional courtesy and good business practice.
4. **Offer alternatives.** If the customer balks at the new price, offer options: a reduced service scope, biweekly instead of weekly service, or specific changes they can make (better landscaping, equipment upgrades) that would reduce your costs and allow a lower fee.

Documentation of your service history — chemical readings, photos, service logs — strengthens your position in these conversations. For more on building trust through documentation, see our guide on [building trust with pool service customers](/blog/building-trust-pool-service-customers/).

## How PoolFlow Helps

PoolFlow includes built-in profit analytics that automatically calculate per-pool profitability using actual chemical usage, service duration, and route data. The money-loser detection feature flags accounts where costs exceed sustainable thresholds, giving you an immediate view of which pools need attention.

The app tracks chemical inventory at the product level and allocates usage to individual pools based on your service logs, eliminating the guesswork that makes manual cost tracking unreliable. Service duration is captured automatically through timestamped check-in and check-out at each stop. Combined with route data that calculates proportional drive time, PoolFlow builds a complete cost picture for every account on your route.

CSV export lets you pull this data into spreadsheets for deeper analysis, while PDF service reports give you the documentation needed to support price conversations with customers. With profit analytics running continuously in the background, you always know which accounts are earning their keep and which are dragging your business down.
