  Accurate chemical dosing separates professional pool technicians from amateurs guessing with scoops and splashes. This article provides the exact dosing rates service professionals need for everyday corrections: muriatic acid for pH, soda ash for pH, sodium bicarbonate for alkalinity, and calcium chloride for hardness, all calculated per 10,000 gallons. We cover pool volume calculation formulas for rectangular, circular, oval, and irregular shapes. The proper sequencing of corrections is detailed, starting with pH, then total alkalinity, then calcium hardness, along with the reasoning behind that order. Safety protocols, waiting times between treatments, and common calculation errors are addressed so technicians can deliver consistent, predictable results on every service visit.
faq:
  - question: "How much muriatic acid do I need to lower pH?"
    answer: "For a standard 31.45 percent muriatic acid solution, you need approximately 26 ounces per 0.2 pH reduction per 10,000 gallons of pool water. For a 15,000-gallon pool with pH at 8.0 that you want to bring down to 7.4, that is a 0.6 pH reduction, which equals three increments of 0.2. Multiply 26 ounces by 3 increments by 1.5 (the volume multiplier for 15,000 gallons), which gives you 117 ounces, or roughly 0.9 gallons. Always add acid to water, never water to acid, and distribute it across the pool surface with the pump running."
  - question: "Should I adjust pH or alkalinity first?"
    answer: "Adjust pH first, then total alkalinity, then calcium hardness. The reason is that both alkalinity adjustments and calcium hardness adjustments can shift pH. If you correct alkalinity first, you may need to re-correct pH afterward, doubling your work. By setting pH first, then fine-tuning alkalinity with sodium bicarbonate (which has a minimal effect on pH compared to soda ash), you reduce the number of corrections needed and get to balanced water faster."

## Why Precise Dosing Matters

Every chemical you add to a pool costs money. Every miscalculation wastes product, wastes time, and risks pushing the water further out of balance than when you started. The pool service industry has a persistent culture of approximation: "a cup of this, a splash of that" might avoid disaster often enough, but it breeds inconsistency. One week you overshoot pH and create cloudy water. The next week you underdose alkalinity and pH bounces back within days.

Precision dosing requires three things: an accurate pool volume, a reliable water test, and the correct dosing rates. This article gives you all three.

## Pool Volume Calculation Formulas

Every dosing calculation starts with pool volume. If your volume is wrong, every chemical measurement downstream is wrong. Take the time to calculate it properly rather than inheriting estimates from previous providers.

### Rectangular Pools

**Volume (gallons) = Length (ft) x Width (ft) x Average Depth (ft) x 7.48**

Average depth = (Shallow End + Deep End) / 2. For a 30 x 15 foot pool with depths of 3.5 and 8 feet: Average Depth = 5.75 ft. Volume = 30 x 15 x 5.75 x 7.48 = 19,359 gallons.

### Circular Pools

**Volume (gallons) = Diameter (ft) x Diameter (ft) x Average Depth (ft) x 5.9**

A 20-foot diameter pool at 4 feet deep: 20 x 20 x 4 x 5.9 = 9,440 gallons.

### Oval and Irregular Shapes

For ovals, use: **Long Diameter x Short Diameter x Average Depth x 5.9**

For kidney or freeform pools, measure the longest length, widest width, and average depth, then apply a shape factor of 0.45 to 0.55: **Length x Width x Average Depth x 7.48 x Shape Factor**

Round your final volume to the nearest 500 gallons. The precision of your dosing does not warrant decimal-level accuracy in volume when variables like water temperature and test technique introduce their own margins of error.

## Dosing Rates for Common Pool Chemicals

These rates are the foundation of every chemical correction you make in the field. Memorize them, print them on a laminated card, or let your service software handle the math.

### Muriatic Acid (31.45% HCl) for Lowering pH

**26 ounces per 0.2 pH reduction per 10,000 gallons**

Example: A 20,000-gallon pool at pH 7.8 targeting 7.4 needs a 0.4 reduction (two increments of 0.2), with a volume multiplier of 2. Dose = 26 x 2 x 2 = 104 ounces, approximately 0.8 gallons.

The 26-ounce rate works well in the typical service range of 7.2 to 8.0. At very high pH (above 8.2), you may need slightly more per increment due to the logarithmic nature of the pH scale. Always retest after treatment.

### Soda Ash (Sodium Carbonate) for Raising pH

**6 ounces per 0.2 pH increase per 10,000 gallons**

Soda ash also raises total alkalinity as a side effect, so use it judiciously when alkalinity is already in range. Pre-dissolve in a bucket of pool water before adding to prevent localized high-pH zones that cause temporary cloudiness.

### Sodium Bicarbonate for Raising Total Alkalinity

**24 ounces per 10 ppm total alkalinity increase per 10,000 gallons**

Sodium bicarbonate is preferred for alkalinity because it has minimal effect on pH compared to soda ash. Target range is typically 80 to 120 ppm, though this varies based on [CYA levels and adjusted alkalinity](/blog/cya-cyanuric-acid-management/).

Example: A 15,000-gallon pool at 60 ppm TA targeting 90 ppm needs a 30 ppm increase (three increments), volume multiplier 1.5. Dose = 24 x 3 x 1.5 = 108 ounces, or 6.75 pounds. For large doses over 5 pounds, consider splitting across two visits.

### Calcium Chloride (77%) for Raising Calcium Hardness

**20 ounces per 10 ppm calcium hardness increase per 10,000 gallons**

Target range: 200 to 400 ppm. Example: A 12,000-gallon pool at 180 ppm targeting 250 ppm needs a 70 ppm increase (seven increments), volume multiplier 1.2. Dose = 20 x 7 x 1.2 = 168 ounces, or 10.5 pounds.

**Critical safety note:** Calcium chloride generates significant heat when dissolving. Always pre-dissolve in a bucket, adding chemical to water slowly. Never dump dry calcium chloride directly into the pool or through the skimmer.

## The Correct Sequencing of Chemical Corrections

When multiple parameters are out of range, order matters.

### Step 1: Adjust pH

pH influences chlorine effectiveness and is shifted by the chemicals used in later steps. Use muriatic acid (26 oz / 0.2 pH / 10k gal) to lower or soda ash (6 oz / 0.2 pH / 10k gal) to raise. Circulate 15 to 20 minutes before retesting.

### Step 2: Adjust Total Alkalinity

Use sodium bicarbonate (24 oz / 10 ppm TA / 10k gal) to raise alkalinity. Lowering alkalinity involves adding muriatic acid to lower both pH and TA, then aerating the water to raise pH back without raising alkalinity. This cycle may need repeating.

Remember the adjusted alkalinity formula when CYA is present: **Adjusted Alkalinity = Total Alkalinity - (CYA / 3)**. This ensures your targets account for cyanurate alkalinity.

### Step 3: Adjust Calcium Hardness

Calcium hardness drifts least between visits, so it comes last. Use calcium chloride (20 oz / 10 ppm CH / 10k gal) to raise it. Like [CYA reduction](/blog/cya-cyanuric-acid-management/), the only option for lowering calcium is partial draining.

### Step 4: Verify

After one full turnover cycle (6 to 8 hours), retest all parameters. Minor pH adjustment may be needed as other chemicals fully disperse.

## Safety Protocols for Chemical Handling

**Never mix chemicals.** Mixing muriatic acid with calcium hypochlorite produces toxic chlorine gas. Use separate, labeled measuring containers for acids, bases, and oxidizers.

**Always add chemical to water.** Adding water to concentrated acid can cause violent exothermic reactions.

**Wear appropriate PPE.** Chemical-resistant gloves and safety glasses at minimum. Add a respirator when handling muriatic acid.

**Pre-dissolve granular chemicals** in a bucket of pool water before adding to the pool to prevent localized concentration spikes.

**Respect waiting times.** After muriatic acid, wait 15 to 20 minutes. After soda ash, 20 to 30 minutes. After calcium chloride, 15 minutes. These intervals allow chemicals to disperse before layering additional corrections.

## Common Dosing Mistakes

**Using the wrong pool volume.** A 20 percent volume error means a 20 percent dosing error. Measure and calculate rather than estimate.

**Not accounting for CYA in alkalinity.** At 60 ppm CYA, subtract 20 ppm from your total alkalinity reading before calculating sodium bicarbonate doses.

**Making all corrections in one visit.** Large simultaneous additions interact unpredictably. Prioritize pH, then address alkalinity and calcium on subsequent visits if corrections are large.

**Dosing without a current test.** Chemistry changes significantly between visits after rain, heavy bather loads, or equipment issues. Always test immediately before dosing.

**Ignoring temperature effects.** The same acid dose has a slightly different effect in 85-degree water versus 65-degree water. Retest after treatment rather than trusting calculation alone.

## Scaling Across Your Route

Servicing 50 or 80 pools per week makes manual dosing calculations a significant time burden and error source. Having a reliable system for translating test results into doses is non-negotiable. The rates in this article are your reference baseline. Build your workflow around them, and your [pricing strategy](/blog/pool-service-pricing-strategies/) can reflect the confidence of consistent, accurate service.
