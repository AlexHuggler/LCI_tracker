executive_summary: |
  Pool water balance is the result of multiple interrelated chemical parameters working in concert, and understanding each one is essential for every service technician. This comprehensive guide covers the six core parameters that define water quality: pH with an ideal range of 7.2 to 7.8, total alkalinity at 80 to 120 ppm, calcium hardness at 200 to 400 ppm, cyanuric acid at 30 to 50 ppm, total dissolved solids, and free chlorine at 1 to 4 ppm. Beyond these fundamentals, the guide examines chloramines and the breakpoint chlorination process, how temperature affects every aspect of water chemistry, and the various testing methods available to technicians including DPD, FAS-DPD, colorimetric, and electronic testing. Each parameter is explained not in isolation but in the context of how it interacts with the others, because true water balance is achieved only when all parameters are managed holistically.

  - question: "What is the ideal pH for a swimming pool?"
    answer: "The ideal pH for a swimming pool is between 7.4 and 7.6, within the broader acceptable range of 7.2 to 7.8. At pH 7.4 to 7.6, chlorine maintains effective sanitizing power while remaining comfortable for swimmers' eyes and skin. Below 7.2, water becomes corrosive to metal equipment and pool surfaces, and chlorine off-gasses more rapidly. Above 7.8, chlorine effectiveness drops dramatically, calcium scale formation increases, and water becomes cloudy. A pH of 7.5 is often cited as the single best target value, balancing sanitizer efficacy with surface protection and swimmer comfort."
  - question: "What happens if calcium hardness is too high?"
    answer: "When calcium hardness exceeds 400 ppm, the water becomes oversaturated with calcium and begins depositing calcium carbonate scale on pool surfaces, inside pipes, on heat exchangers, and at the waterline. This scale buildup reduces filtration efficiency, restricts water flow, decreases heater performance and can cause heater failure, creates rough surfaces that harbor algae and bacteria, and produces cloudy water. High calcium hardness also pushes the Langelier Saturation Index into the positive scale-forming range. The only practical ways to reduce calcium hardness are partial drain and refill with lower-hardness source water or reverse osmosis treatment. Prevention through regular testing and proactive water management is far preferable to remediation."

## Introduction: Why Water Chemistry Matters

Water chemistry is the core technical discipline of pool service. Every other aspect of pool maintenance, from equipment performance to surface longevity to swimmer safety, is ultimately governed by the chemical state of the water. A pool with perfectly functioning pumps, filters, and heaters will still develop problems if the water chemistry is out of balance. Conversely, properly balanced water can compensate for many equipment limitations and extend the life of every component it touches.

For service technicians, water chemistry knowledge is what transforms routine pool cleaning into professional pool management. Customers hire pool service companies not just to skim leaves and vacuum debris, but to protect what is often a $50,000 to $100,000 investment in their pool and its equipment. Delivering that protection requires a thorough understanding of the parameters covered in this guide.

This article examines each water chemistry parameter in detail, explains how they interact with one another, and provides the practical knowledge that service technicians need to maintain optimal water balance across every pool in their route.

## pH: The Central Parameter

pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water on a logarithmic scale from 0 to 14. In pool chemistry, pH is the single most frequently tested and adjusted parameter, and for good reason. It influences virtually every other aspect of water chemistry.

### The Ideal Range: 7.2 to 7.8

The acceptable pH range for swimming pools is 7.2 to 7.8, with an ideal target of 7.4 to 7.6. This range is not arbitrary. It represents the intersection of several competing requirements.

**Sanitizer efficacy** is highly pH-dependent. At pH 7.2, approximately 63% of free chlorine exists as hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active sanitizing form. At pH 7.8, that percentage drops to approximately 33%. This means chlorine is roughly twice as effective at the low end of the acceptable range compared to the high end. Maintaining pH at 7.4 to 7.6 provides a practical balance between sanitizing power and the other considerations described below.

**Swimmer comfort** is optimized in the 7.2 to 7.8 range because this closely matches the natural pH of human tears (approximately 7.4). Water outside this range causes eye irritation, skin dryness, and discomfort that swimmers attribute to "too much chlorine" even when chlorine levels are normal.

**Surface and equipment protection** requires pH to remain above 7.2. Below this value, water becomes increasingly corrosive, attacking metal components, dissolving plaster surfaces, and degrading pool equipment. The relationship between pH and surface protection is quantified through the [Langelier Saturation Index](/blog/langelier-saturation-index-explained/), where pH is the most influential single variable.

### pH Adjustment

To lower pH, add muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) at a rate of 26 ounces per 10,000 gallons of pool water for each 0.2 decrease in pH desired. Muriatic acid also lowers total alkalinity, so both parameters should be considered when dosing.

To raise pH, add soda ash (sodium carbonate) at a rate of 6 ounces per 10,000 gallons for each 0.2 increase in pH desired. Soda ash also raises total alkalinity. In situations where pH needs to rise without a corresponding alkalinity increase, aeration is an effective alternative. Aeration raises pH by driving off dissolved carbon dioxide without affecting alkalinity.

## Total Alkalinity: The pH Buffer

Total alkalinity measures the water's ability to resist changes in pH, a property known as buffering capacity. It represents the concentration of carbonate, bicarbonate, and hydroxide ions in the water, measured in parts per million.

### The Ideal Range: 80 to 120 ppm

Total alkalinity should be maintained between 80 and 120 ppm for most pool types. Plaster pools generally perform best at the higher end of this range (100 to 120 ppm), while fiberglass and vinyl pools can operate comfortably at the lower end (80 to 100 ppm).

**Low alkalinity (below 80 ppm)** results in pH that is unstable and prone to rapid fluctuation. This condition, sometimes called "pH bounce," makes it extremely difficult to maintain consistent pH. A small addition of acid or base causes a large pH swing because the water lacks the buffering capacity to absorb the change. Low alkalinity also contributes to corrosive conditions and a lower LSI.

**High alkalinity (above 120 ppm)** causes pH to resist adjustment, making it difficult to bring pH down into the ideal range. High alkalinity also contributes to scale formation, cloudiness, and a higher LSI. The water tends to lock pH at elevated levels, creating a cascade of problems.

### Alkalinity Adjustment

To raise total alkalinity, add sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) at 24 ounces per 10,000 gallons for each 10 ppm increase desired. Sodium bicarbonate has a minimal effect on pH, making it the preferred alkalinity adjuster when pH is already in range.

Lowering total alkalinity is more complex. Adding muriatic acid will lower both alkalinity and pH. The technique for lowering alkalinity without excessively lowering pH involves adding acid to lower both parameters, then aerating to raise pH back up without raising alkalinity. This acid-and-aerate cycle may need to be repeated several times to achieve the desired alkalinity reduction while maintaining proper pH.

### The Alkalinity-pH Relationship

Total alkalinity and pH are inextricably linked. Most pH adjusting chemicals also affect alkalinity, and alkalinity determines how stable your pH adjustments will be. This interdependence is why experienced technicians always adjust alkalinity first, then fine-tune pH. Attempting to adjust pH when alkalinity is out of range is an exercise in frustration, as the pH will not hold.

## Calcium Hardness: Protecting Surfaces

Calcium hardness measures the concentration of dissolved calcium ions in the pool water, expressed in parts per million. Calcium is essential for the protection of cementitious pool surfaces, including plaster, marcite, pebble, and quartz finishes.

### The Ideal Range: 200 to 400 ppm

**Low calcium hardness (below 200 ppm)** means the water is hungry for calcium and will aggressively dissolve it from any available source. In plaster pools, this causes etching, roughening, and discoloration of the pool surface. In all pool types, low calcium contributes to corrosion of metal components. The LSI reflects this risk: low calcium hardness produces a lower Calcium Factor and a lower LSI value, pushing toward the corrosive range.

**High calcium hardness (above 400 ppm)** leads to scale formation. Excess dissolved calcium precipitates as calcium carbonate on pool surfaces, inside plumbing, on heat exchangers, and in filters. Scale reduces equipment efficiency, restricts water flow, and creates rough surfaces that harbor bacteria and algae.

### Calcium Hardness Adjustment

To raise calcium hardness, add calcium chloride at 20 ounces per 10,000 gallons for each 10 ppm increase desired. Calcium chloride dissolves readily and takes effect quickly. Pre-dissolve it in a bucket of pool water before broadcasting to avoid high-concentration contact with pool surfaces.

Lowering calcium hardness cannot be achieved through chemical addition. The only practical methods are partial drain and refill with lower-hardness source water and reverse osmosis water treatment. This is why proactive calcium management is essential. In areas with hard source water, calcium hardness should be tested at every service visit and addressed before it climbs above 400 ppm.

## Cyanuric Acid (CYA): Chlorine's Shield

Cyanuric acid, also known as stabilizer or conditioner, protects free chlorine from degradation by ultraviolet sunlight. Without CYA, sunlight can destroy up to 90% of free chlorine in a pool within two hours. With proper CYA levels, chlorine residual is maintained throughout the day with far less chemical consumption.

### The Ideal Range: 30 to 50 ppm

**Low CYA (below 30 ppm)** provides insufficient chlorine protection. Pools with low CYA consume chlorine rapidly, requiring frequent additions and creating inconsistent sanitizer levels between service visits.

**High CYA (above 50 ppm)** begins to over-stabilize chlorine, reducing its sanitizing effectiveness. CYA binds with free chlorine, and as CYA levels increase, a greater proportion of the chlorine is bound in the chlorine-CYA complex rather than existing as the active hypochlorous acid form. At CYA levels above 80 to 100 ppm, chlorine effectiveness is significantly compromised, and algae growth may occur despite apparently adequate free chlorine readings.

### CYA and LSI

CYA has an important secondary effect on water balance through its interaction with total alkalinity. As explained in detail in our [LSI guide](/blog/langelier-saturation-index-explained/), approximately one-third of the CYA concentration sequesters carbonate alkalinity. The CYA correction formula, adjusted alkalinity equals total alkalinity minus CYA divided by three, must be applied when calculating the Langelier Saturation Index. Ignoring this correction produces falsely elevated LSI readings that mask corrosive conditions.

### CYA Management

CYA is added to pools through stabilized chlorine products (trichlor and dichlor) and through direct addition of granular cyanuric acid. It is not consumed or degraded under normal conditions, meaning it accumulates over time. The only way to reduce CYA is through dilution via partial drain and refill.

Pools that rely exclusively on trichlor tablets for sanitation experience a gradual CYA buildup that can reach problematic levels within a single season. Monitoring CYA at every service visit and planning partial drains before levels exceed 70 to 80 ppm is a key aspect of proactive water management.

## Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

Total dissolved solids represents the sum of all dissolved substances in the pool water, including minerals, salts, organic compounds, and chemical residues. TDS increases over time as water evaporates (leaving dissolved solids behind) and as chemicals are added.

### Acceptable Levels

For standard pools, TDS should generally remain below 2,000 ppm. The more relevant guideline is that TDS should not exceed 1,500 ppm above the source water TDS. If your fill water has a TDS of 500 ppm, the pool's TDS should not exceed 2,000 ppm.

Saltwater pools are the exception. Salt chlorine generators require a salt level of 2,700 to 3,400 ppm, which directly contributes to TDS. Saltwater pools typically have TDS readings of 3,000 to 6,000 ppm, which is normal and expected.

### TDS Effects on Water Quality

Elevated TDS can reduce chlorine efficiency, contribute to cloudy or dull-looking water, increase conductivity and the potential for galvanic corrosion, affect the TDS Constant in the LSI calculation (shifting from 12.1 to 12.2), and leave visible residue on pool surfaces as water evaporates.

Like CYA and calcium hardness, TDS can only be reduced through dilution. Regular partial drain and refill is the standard practice for managing TDS accumulation.

## Free Chlorine: The Primary Sanitizer

Free chlorine is the active sanitizer in the vast majority of swimming pools. It exists in two forms: hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and the hypochlorite ion (OCl-). Hypochlorous acid is the effective killing form, and the ratio between the two forms is determined by pH, which is why pH management is so critical to sanitation.

### The Ideal Range: 1 to 4 ppm

The recommended free chlorine level for residential pools is 1 to 4 ppm, with 2 to 4 ppm preferred for commercial pools. These levels provide adequate sanitation while minimizing chlorine odor, swimmer irritation, and chemical costs.

**Low free chlorine (below 1 ppm)** provides inadequate sanitation. Bacteria, viruses, and algae can proliferate when free chlorine drops below effective levels. For commercial pools, most health codes mandate a minimum of 1 ppm free chlorine at all times during operation.

**High free chlorine (above 4 ppm)** can cause swimmer discomfort, bleach swimwear, and accelerate the degradation of certain pool equipment and surfaces. Free chlorine above 10 ppm is considered unsafe for swimming.

### Chlorine Demand

Chlorine demand refers to the amount of chlorine consumed by contaminants in the water before a measurable residual is established. Organic matter, nitrogen compounds, ammonia, and other contaminants react with and consume free chlorine. High bather loads, organic debris, and environmental contaminants all increase chlorine demand.

Understanding chlorine demand helps technicians size their chlorine additions appropriately and diagnose situations where chlorine seems to "disappear" despite regular additions. A pool that consistently shows low free chlorine despite adequate dosing likely has a high chlorine demand that needs to be addressed through shock treatment and improved filtration.

## Combined Chlorine and Chloramines

When free chlorine reacts with nitrogen compounds, particularly ammonia and urea introduced by swimmers, it forms combined chlorine compounds known as chloramines. Chloramines are the actual source of the harsh "chlorine smell" and eye irritation that people associate with over-chlorinated pools. Ironically, these symptoms indicate insufficient free chlorine rather than excessive chlorine.

### Measuring Combined Chlorine

Combined chlorine is calculated as the difference between total chlorine and free chlorine. Both values are obtained during standard water testing:

Combined Chlorine = Total Chlorine - Free Chlorine

Combined chlorine should be maintained below 0.2 ppm. Levels above 0.2 ppm indicate that chloramine formation is outpacing the water's ability to break down these compounds.

### Breakpoint Chlorination

The remedy for elevated combined chlorine is breakpoint chlorination, commonly known as shocking the pool. Breakpoint chlorination requires adding enough free chlorine to oxidize all chloramines and other combined chlorine compounds. The breakpoint is reached when the free chlorine addition equals approximately 10 times the measured combined chlorine level.

For example, if combined chlorine is 0.5 ppm, a free chlorine addition of approximately 5 ppm above the existing free chlorine level is needed to achieve breakpoint. This is a significant dose that temporarily raises free chlorine well above normal operating levels, which is why shock treatment is typically performed in the evening when the pool is not in use and UV degradation is minimal.

## Temperature Effects on Water Chemistry

Water temperature influences nearly every aspect of pool chemistry, and service technicians must account for seasonal temperature changes in their water management strategies.

### Temperature and Sanitizer Performance

Chlorine is consumed more rapidly in warmer water because biological activity increases with temperature. Bacteria, algae, and other organisms grow faster in warm water, increasing chlorine demand. A pool that maintains adequate chlorine at 70 degrees Fahrenheit may struggle to hold residual at 85 degrees Fahrenheit without increased dosing.

### Temperature and pH

Carbon dioxide solubility decreases as water temperature rises. Since dissolved CO2 contributes to acidity, warmer water tends to have a higher pH than cooler water, all else being equal. This natural pH drift is one reason pools tend to require more acid during summer months.

### Temperature and the LSI

Temperature directly affects the LSI through the Temperature Factor. As discussed in our [detailed LSI guide](/blog/langelier-saturation-index-explained/), the Temperature Factor ranges from 0.0 at 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 0.9 at 105 degrees Fahrenheit. A pool that is perfectly balanced in summer can become significantly corrosive in winter solely due to the temperature change, even if all chemical parameters remain constant.

This seasonal LSI shift is one of the most commonly overlooked aspects of water management. Technicians who maintain the same chemical targets year-round may inadvertently allow corrosive conditions to develop during cooler months. Proactive seasonal adjustment of pH, alkalinity, or calcium hardness to compensate for the lower Temperature Factor protects pool surfaces during these vulnerable periods.

## Testing Methods

Accurate water testing is the foundation of effective water chemistry management. Several testing methods are available, each with distinct advantages and limitations.

### DPD Testing

The DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine) method is the industry standard for chlorine testing. DPD reagents produce a pink color in the presence of chlorine, with color intensity proportional to chlorine concentration. DPD-1 measures free chlorine, while DPD-3 (added after DPD-1) measures total chlorine, allowing calculation of combined chlorine.

DPD testing is preferred over the older OTO (orthotolidine) method because DPD distinguishes between free and combined chlorine, while OTO measures only total chlorine. Most health departments require DPD testing for commercial pools.

### FAS-DPD Testing

FAS-DPD (Ferrous Ammonium Sulfate - DPD) is a titration-based method that provides greater accuracy than standard DPD colorimetric testing. Rather than comparing color intensity visually, FAS-DPD uses a drop count to determine chlorine concentration. This method eliminates the subjectivity of color matching and provides reliable results even at high chlorine levels where DPD color comparison becomes difficult.

FAS-DPD testing is particularly valuable for measuring combined chlorine at low concentrations and for testing during breakpoint chlorination when free chlorine levels are temporarily elevated.

### Digital Photometers

Digital photometers use a light source and sensor to measure the color intensity of reagent-treated samples. They eliminate the subjectivity of visual color matching and provide numerical results with greater precision and repeatability. Photometers are available for chlorine, pH, alkalinity, calcium hardness, CYA, and many other parameters.

While more expensive than manual test kits, digital photometers improve testing accuracy and consistency across different technicians. For service companies managing multiple commercial accounts where testing accuracy has regulatory implications, photometers are a worthwhile investment.

### Test Strips

Test strips provide quick, convenient readings for multiple parameters simultaneously. However, their accuracy is generally lower than liquid reagent methods, and they are subject to degradation from heat and moisture exposure. Test strips are acceptable for quick residential pool checks but are generally not considered adequate for commercial pool compliance testing.

### Professional Laboratory Testing

For parameters that are difficult to measure accurately in the field, such as TDS, metals, and phosphates, professional laboratory analysis provides the most reliable results. Many pool service companies submit water samples to a laboratory at the beginning of each season and whenever unusual water conditions are encountered. Laboratory results also serve as a calibration check for field testing equipment.

## Putting It All Together: Holistic Water Management

The key insight for service technicians is that water chemistry parameters do not exist in isolation. They form an interconnected system where adjusting one parameter inevitably affects others. pH and alkalinity are directly linked through carbonate chemistry. CYA affects both chlorine efficacy and the effective alkalinity for LSI purposes. Temperature influences sanitizer demand, pH drift, and the saturation index simultaneously.

Effective water management requires a holistic approach. Rather than chasing individual parameters to their ideal values one at a time, experienced technicians assess the complete chemical picture and develop adjustment strategies that move multiple parameters toward their targets simultaneously. The Langelier Saturation Index, with its formula of LSI equals pH plus Temperature Factor plus Calcium Factor plus Alkalinity Factor minus TDS Constant, provides the integrating framework that ties individual parameters together into a single measure of water balance.

The priority order for adjustments should generally be total alkalinity first (since it affects pH stability), then pH, then calcium hardness and CYA. Chlorine adjustments can typically be made independently of the balance parameters, though pH must be in range for chlorine to function effectively.

## How PoolFlow Helps

PoolFlow transforms water chemistry management from a manual, error-prone process into a streamlined digital workflow. The platform accepts test results from any testing method, whether entered manually from field test kits or imported from digital photometers, and instantly calculates the complete water balance picture including the Langelier Saturation Index with automatic CYA correction, where adjusted alkalinity equals total alkalinity minus CYA divided by three. When any parameter falls outside its ideal range, PoolFlow calculates exact dosing recommendations based on the pool's volume, using industry-standard rates: muriatic acid at 26 ounces per 10,000 gallons per 0.2 pH drop, soda ash at 6 ounces per 10,000 gallons per 0.2 pH rise, sodium bicarbonate at 24 ounces per 10,000 gallons per 10 ppm alkalinity increase, and calcium chloride at 20 ounces per 10,000 gallons per 10 ppm calcium increase. Historical tracking across service visits reveals trends in every parameter, allowing technicians to anticipate problems and adjust proactively. For commercial accounts requiring [regulatory compliance](/blog/commercial-pool-vs-residential-regulations/), PoolFlow generates the documentation and audit trails that health departments require, while its route management features ensure every pool receives timely, consistent service.
