executive_summary: |
  Pool service is a year-round profession, and each season demands a different focus from the technician. This comprehensive checklist covers the four critical phases of the annual pool maintenance cycle: spring opening, summer peak season, fall transition, and winter closing. Each section details the specific chemical ranges to target, equipment inspections to perform, and customer communication strategies that keep clients informed and satisfied. Spring opening requires methodical startup procedures to avoid surface damage. Summer demands aggressive sanitation management under heavy bather loads and intense UV exposure. Fall is about transitioning chemistry for lower temperatures and lighter use. Winter closing, when applicable, protects the pool investment through months of dormancy. Following a structured seasonal protocol reduces callbacks, improves water quality, and strengthens client retention.
faq:
  - question: "When should I open pools for the season?"
    answer: "The ideal timing depends on your climate zone, but a general guideline is to open pools when ambient temperatures consistently reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. In the southern United States, this can be as early as March. In the northern states, late April to mid-May is typical. Opening too late allows algae to establish in warming water under the cover, making startup significantly more difficult and expensive. Proactive service professionals begin contacting customers about opening schedules 4 to 6 weeks before the expected opening window."
  - question: "Do pools need maintenance in winter?"
    answer: "Yes, though the scope depends on the climate. In regions where pools are closed with covers, monthly inspections are recommended to check cover condition, water level, and antifreeze levels in plumbing. In warmer climates where pools remain open year-round, winter maintenance continues on a reduced schedule, typically biweekly, with adjusted chemical targets for lower water temperatures. Neglecting winter maintenance invites staining, algae growth under covers, and equipment damage from freezing, all of which create expensive problems at spring opening."

## The Four Seasons of Pool Service

Pool maintenance is not a static discipline. The demands placed on water chemistry, equipment, and your service schedule shift dramatically across the calendar year. A technician who applies the same approach in January as in July is either wasting time and chemicals or falling short of what the water actually needs.

This seasonal checklist is designed for service professionals who manage residential and light commercial accounts. It provides a structured framework for each phase of the annual cycle, with specific chemical targets, equipment inspection protocols, and customer communication timelines. Whether you operate in a climate with full seasonal closings or service pools year-round in a southern market, the principles here apply. Adapt the timing to your region, but follow the sequence.

## Spring Opening: March Through May

Spring opening is the most labor-intensive service event of the year. It sets the tone for the entire season. A clean, well-executed opening earns customer confidence. A sloppy one generates callbacks and complaints that persist for months.

### Pre-Opening Customer Communication

Contact your customers 4 to 6 weeks before your planned opening dates. This accomplishes three things: it confirms they want to continue service, it allows you to schedule openings in a manageable sequence across your route, and it gives customers time to address any off-season repairs (deck work, equipment replacements, landscaping around the pool) before you arrive.

Send a brief message outlining what the opening service includes, what it costs, and what the customer should expect. If you plan to increase your [service pricing](/blog/pool-service-pricing-strategies/) for the new season, communicate that change before the opening, not during it.

### Opening Day Protocol

**Step 1: Visual inspection.** Before touching the water, walk the deck and inspect the pool shell, coping, tile line, and any visible equipment. Document any damage, staining, or changes from closing. Take photos. This protects you from being blamed for pre-existing issues.

**Step 2: Remove and clean the cover.** If the pool was winterized with a safety cover or solid cover, remove it carefully to minimize debris falling into the water. Clean the cover, let it dry, fold it, and store it properly. A damaged cover is an opportunity to offer replacement or repair services.

**Step 3: Reconnect equipment.** Remove winterizing plugs from the pump, filter, heater, and any auxiliary equipment. Reinstall drain plugs. Reconnect the pump and filter. If an air pillow or Gizzmo was used in the skimmer, remove it. Check that all valves are in their normal operating positions.

**Step 4: Fill to operating level.** Top off the pool to the middle of the skimmer opening. This may take several hours depending on the water level lost over winter.

**Step 5: Prime and start the pump.** Prime the pump, open the air relief valve on the filter, and start the system. Verify flow through the filter, heater, and all return lines. Listen for unusual noises from the pump, which may indicate a failing bearing or impeller issue.

**Step 6: Test and balance water chemistry.** This is where precision matters. Opening water chemistry targets should be:

- **pH:** 7.2 to 7.6 (start toward the lower end since shocking will push pH up)
- **Total Alkalinity:** 80 to 120 ppm
- **Calcium Hardness:** 200 to 400 ppm (test source water hardness for new fill)
- **CYA (Cyanuric Acid):** 30 to 50 ppm (will be low after winter dilution and refilling)
- **Free Chlorine:** 1 to 3 ppm (before shocking)

Use the correct [chemical dosing calculations](/blog/chemical-dosing-calculations-pool-service/) and follow the proper sequencing: pH first, then total alkalinity, then calcium hardness. Remember to apply the [CYA-adjusted alkalinity formula](/blog/cya-cyanuric-acid-management/) when calculating LSI.

**Step 7: Shock the pool.** Apply a breakpoint chlorination dose, typically 10 to 12 ppm free chlorine, to oxidize organic contamination accumulated over winter. Use liquid chlorine or cal-hypo for the shock treatment to avoid adding unnecessary CYA at the start of the season.

**Step 8: Run the filter continuously.** The pool should run 24 hours a day for the first 48 to 72 hours after opening. Clean or backwash the filter after the first 24 hours, as it will collect significant debris during the initial circulation.

### Equipment Checklist for Spring

- Inspect pump basket and lid O-ring for cracks
- Check filter pressure gauge accuracy (compare to clean baseline)
- Inspect heater for rodent nests, corrosion, or debris
- Test salt cell (if applicable) for scale buildup and clean with mild acid solution
- Inspect automatic cleaner hoses, wheels, and connections
- Check timer or automation system programming
- Inspect all plumbing unions and valves for leaks
- Test GFCI outlets and bonding connections

## Summer Peak Season: June Through August

Summer is the highest-demand period for both water chemistry and your service schedule. Bather loads peak, UV exposure is at its maximum, water temperatures climb, and algae pressure is relentless. This is the season that tests your systems, your chemistry knowledge, and your efficiency.

### Weekly Chemical Targets for Summer

- **pH:** 7.4 to 7.6
- **Total Alkalinity:** 80 to 120 ppm
- **Free Chlorine:** 2 to 4 ppm (adjust based on CYA level; maintain the 7.5% CYA-to-chlorine ratio)
- **CYA:** 30 to 50 ppm (monitor monthly for accumulation if using stabilized chlorine)
- **Calcium Hardness:** 200 to 400 ppm
- **Phosphates:** Below 300 ppb (test monthly; treat with phosphate remover if elevated)

### Summer Service Priorities

**Chlorine demand management.** High temperatures accelerate chlorine consumption. A pool at 90 degrees uses chlorine roughly twice as fast as one at 70 degrees. Combined with peak UV exposure and heavy swimmer loads, you may need to increase chlorine dosing by 50 to 100 percent over spring levels. Monitor CYA closely to ensure the stabilizer is providing adequate UV protection without climbing too high.

**Algae prevention.** The best algae treatment is prevention. Maintain adequate free chlorine relative to CYA, brush walls and steps weekly, and ensure good water circulation. If algae appears despite good chemistry, investigate dead spots in circulation, check the filter for channeling, and look for phosphate sources (fertilizer runoff, organic debris).

**Filter maintenance.** Increase your filter cleaning frequency during summer. Cartridge filters may need cleaning every 2 to 3 weeks rather than monthly. Sand filters benefit from a mid-season backwash and rinse cycle. DE filters should be broken down and cleaned at least once during the summer.

**Water level monitoring.** Evaporation and splash-out accelerate in summer. A pool can lose a quarter inch of water per day in hot, dry climates. Low water levels starve the skimmer of flow, reducing filtration efficiency and potentially damaging the pump.

### Mid-Summer Equipment Check

Perform a mid-season equipment inspection in July:

- Check pump motor temperature (should not be too hot to touch)
- Inspect filter pressure (clean if more than 8 to 10 PSI above clean baseline)
- Verify heater operation (many customers use heaters even in summer for spa features)
- Check automatic cleaner performance and wear parts
- Inspect pool light fixtures for moisture intrusion
- Test water features and valves for proper operation

## Fall Transition: September Through November

Fall is the season most often neglected by service professionals, yet it presents unique challenges. Water temperatures drop, bather loads decrease, and organic debris increases dramatically as trees shed leaves. The transition from summer chemistry to fall chemistry requires deliberate adjustments.

### Adjusted Chemical Targets for Fall

- **pH:** 7.2 to 7.6
- **Total Alkalinity:** 80 to 120 ppm
- **Free Chlorine:** 1 to 3 ppm (lower demand allows reduced dosing)
- **CYA:** 30 to 50 ppm (test and plan for any needed dilution before closing)
- **Calcium Hardness:** 200 to 400 ppm

### Fall Service Priorities

**Debris management.** Falling leaves, seeds, and pollen are the primary challenge in fall. Organic debris introduces phosphates and nitrogen into the water, fueling algae growth. Skim thoroughly, clean skimmer baskets more frequently, and consider recommending a leaf net to customers with heavily treed yards.

**Reduced chemical demand.** As water temperatures drop below 75 degrees, chlorine demand decreases noticeably. Reduce your dosing accordingly to avoid maintaining unnecessarily high chlorine levels that waste chemicals and increase costs. This is the time to let CYA protection do its work with lower chlorine inputs.

**CYA assessment.** Fall is the ideal time to test CYA and plan any [partial drain needed to reduce accumulated stabilizer](/blog/cya-cyanuric-acid-management/). Performing a dilution in fall, before closing, means the pool opens in spring with CYA already in range.

**Equipment evaluation.** Document the condition of all equipment and communicate any recommended repairs or replacements to the customer. Heaters, pump motors, and salt cells that are showing wear should be addressed before winter, when contractors are less busy and parts are more available.

### Customer Communication for Fall

Reach out to customers in September or early October to discuss:

- Closing timeline and scheduling
- Any recommended repairs before winter
- Cover condition and replacement needs
- Pricing for closing service
- Expectations for winter monitoring (if offered)

Early communication prevents the last-minute scramble that leads to rushed closings and missed details.

## Winter Closing: November Through February

In climates where pools are closed for winter, the closing procedure is as critical as the opening. Mistakes made during closing create expensive problems in spring, from cracked plumbing to severe staining.

### Closing Day Protocol

**Step 1: Final water balance.** Before closing, balance the water to these winter targets:

- **pH:** 7.2 to 7.6
- **Total Alkalinity:** 80 to 120 ppm
- **Calcium Hardness:** 200 to 350 ppm
- **Free Chlorine:** 1 to 3 ppm (after winter chemical treatment)

**Step 2: Shock and add winterizing chemicals.** Apply a shock treatment at 10 to 12 ppm free chlorine. Add algaecide per manufacturer instructions. Some technicians also add a metal sequestrant to prevent staining during the long stagnant period.

**Step 3: Lower water level.** Drop the water level to 4 to 6 inches below the skimmer opening (for mesh covers) or 12 to 18 inches below the tile line (for solid covers), depending on the cover type and local frost line depth.

**Step 4: Blow out plumbing lines.** Use a shop vacuum or dedicated blower to force water out of all plumbing lines, including suction lines, return lines, and any auxiliary lines (spa jets, water features, automatic cleaner lines). Plug all return fittings and skimmer lines with winterizing plugs.

**Step 5: Add antifreeze to plumbing.** Pour non-toxic pool antifreeze into the skimmer lines and any plumbing that could not be fully cleared. This provides a secondary layer of freeze protection.

**Step 6: Drain equipment.** Open all drain plugs on the pump, filter, heater, and chlorinator. Remove the pump drain plug and store it in the pump basket for easy retrieval in spring. If the pool has a salt cell, remove it and store it indoors.

**Step 7: Install the cover.** Secure the safety cover or solid cover according to manufacturer specifications. Ensure all anchors are tight and springs are properly tensioned. For solid covers, install a cover pump to prevent water accumulation.

**Step 8: Document everything.** Log closing water chemistry readings, equipment condition, and any notes for the spring opening. Take photos of the closed pool. This documentation is invaluable for spring startup and protects your professional reputation.

### Winter Monitoring

Even closed pools benefit from periodic inspection. Offer a monthly winter check that includes:

- Verifying cover integrity and removing debris or standing water
- Checking water level (significant drops may indicate a leak)
- Inspecting equipment area for rodent damage or weather impacts
- Confirming antifreeze is still visible in skimmer

This is a low-effort, high-value add-on service that generates revenue during the off-season and positions you as a thorough, year-round professional. It also gives you early warning of problems that would otherwise surprise you at opening.

### Year-Round Pools in Warm Climates

For pools in climates where closing is not necessary, winter maintenance shifts to a reduced schedule rather than a full shutdown. Biweekly service visits are typically sufficient from November through February. Lower water temperatures mean reduced chlorine demand, slower algae growth, and less evaporation. Adjust your chemical dosing downward accordingly, but do not neglect water balance. Corrosion and scale formation continue regardless of temperature.

Run the pump for fewer hours per day, typically 4 to 6 hours, to save the customer on energy costs while maintaining adequate filtration. Continue to monitor and log all chemistry parameters, as unexpected rain events and temperature swings can disrupt balance quickly.

## Building Your Annual Service Calendar

The most efficient service professionals plan their seasonal transitions weeks in advance. Here is a high-level annual calendar:

- **February-March:** Contact customers about spring openings, schedule dates
- **March-May:** Perform spring openings, full equipment inspections
- **June-August:** Peak season service, mid-summer equipment check in July
- **September-October:** Contact customers about closing timelines, perform CYA assessments
- **October-December:** Perform winter closings, transition to off-season schedules
- **December-February:** Winter monitoring, equipment maintenance, route planning for next season

Building this structure into your [business operations](/blog/start-pool-service-business-guide/) ensures nothing falls through the cracks and gives your customers confidence in your professionalism.
